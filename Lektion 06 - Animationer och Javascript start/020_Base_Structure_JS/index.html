  <!-- JavaScript code inside script tag, can be anywhere on in html-->
  <script>
      console.log('from the html file but first');

  <!-- JavaScript code located inside an external document, all that code runs when this line is executed

External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages.

JavaScript files have the file extension .js.

To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a <script> tag:



  -->
  <script src="base.js"></script>
</head>
<body>

  
 
  <!--
    JavaScript code inside script tag
    This code will run after the 2 script tags above
  -->
  <script>  
    console.log('from the html file');
  </script>
</body>


 <!--
    JavaScript code inside script tag
    This code will run after the 3 script tags above
  -->
  <script>  
    console.log(' also from the html file');
  </script>
